# Prêmios de Torneio

## Medalhas de Perfil

A equipe osu! pode (à vontade deles), providenciar a um torneio gerenciado pela comunidade uma medalha, uma recompensa especial que é visível no perfil do jogador.

Essas medalhas geralmente mostram a habilidade e domínio de um jogador numa competição, e assim são regulamentados para que eles mantenham seu valor.

Medalhas de perfil são permanentes. Isso significa que quaisquer medalhas ganhadas de forma legítima não serão removidas do perfil de um jogador.

### Critério para Torneios

Nós poderemos providenciar medalhas para os **vencedores** de torneios comunitários que seguem os seguintes critérios:

- O torneio é organizado e executado por uma *equipe experiente de voluntários com boa reputação***¹**, **OU**, o torneio foi concluído pelo menos uma vez no passado sem oferecer recompensas.
- O pedido da medalha é feito **bem antes** do torneio começar as partidas. (*Nós sugerimos pelo menos duas a três semanas.*)
- Todos os membros involvidos na administração do torneio não estão participando dos torneios eles mesmos.
- O torneio é executado quatro ou menos vezes por ano (sazonal).
- A lista de jogadores em tal torneio foi revisada pela Equipe de Suporte e certificada de ser livre de jogadores suspeitos.
- O torneio não é "self-reffed". Isso significa que um juiz deve estar presente em todas as partidas.

**¹**: Membros "experientes" são vagamente definidos como pessoas que contruibuíram significativamente para a execução bem-sucedida de ao menos **três** torneios que haviam premiados medalhas, ou foram uma parte da equipe da osu! World Cup.

Em alguns casos, a equipe osu! pode premiar medalhas de perfil para primeira, segunda, e terceira colocação para torneios de larga escala (ex. Corsace Open). Cada caso irá ser considerado individualmente.

### Revisamento do Torneio

Como parte de premiar apoio oficial, promoção ou outros prêmios, a Equipe de Suporte oferece uma forma limitada de verificação similar às 'revisões de segurança' feitos por todos os jogadores da World Cup.

**Apenas torneios que qualificam para todos os outros critérios podem se candidatar para revisão.** Nós altamente sugerimos envolver moderadores experientes em seu torneio se você está planejando fazer um novo torneio para que possa se qualificar para isso.

Organizadores do torneio necessitam providenciar o seguinte:

- Uma lista separada por vírgula (ou uma planilha) incluindo nomes de usuário e IDs dos jogadores
- Se o torneio é baseado em equipes, essa lista precisa refletir o agrupamento dos jogadores em suas equipes, completa com o nome da equipe ou qualquer marcador que seja identificável

A lista separada por vírgula deve se parecer como:

```csv
Jogador1, 1234567
Jogador2, 1234567
Jogador3, 1234567
```

Once the screening is complete, the Support Team will provide a list of all players from your lineup who are considered **ineligible** for supported tournament play, be it via severe account infringement, suspicion of account sharing, or having been the product of a recent ban appeal within the past 12 months.

The nature of their particular transgression will not be specified, and no further information will be given on the state of those user's accounts. Please do not request specifics or "proof", they will not be given. Individual players unhappy with their screening outcomes should be directed to consult accounts@ppy.sh via email.

Tournament organizers who uncover potentially suspicious play during their tournaments are both obligated and singlehandedly responsible for reporting any such incidents to the Support Team via tournaments@ppy.sh at the earliest possible opportunity as part of this service.

**Allowing users that have been highlighted by the screening process to play in your tournament will result in an immediate withdrawal of any prize offerings or promotional support from us, and you are unlikely to have any of your further requests for prize/promotion support acknowledged in the future.**

If a player that is participating in a tournament is restricted, part of the tournament may have to be replayed in order to keep its competitive integrity. Tournament organizers should contact the Support Team to receive further information about this.

### Badge Design Criteria

Profile badges are expected to adhere to a few minimum standards before they are accepted.

Please read these carefully - if your proposed badge violates any of these, it may be refused!

- The badge image file MUST be either PNG or JPG/JPEG in format.
    - If the badge design contains any transparency, it MUST be in PNG format instead.
- The dimensions of the badge image file MUST NOT exceed 86x40, or 86x34 at the absolute minimum. (*86x40 is the preferred format for all badges and you will be questioned for using 86x34, and outright refused for anything smaller.*)
- The badge image file MUST be below 50kb in size. (*We suggest using [FileOptimizer](https://nikkhokkho.sourceforge.io/static.php?page=FileOptimizer) if you're having trouble with this.*)
- The badge MUST clearly display the logo or name of your tournament. (*You may substitute this for a visual motif or a theme so long as it is obvious enough.*)
- The badge MUST be cleanly designed and of reasonable visual quality.

**We also require a 2x (or 'retina') version of your badge for display on the new website.** It is highly recommended to design your badge in 2x (aka: 172x80 resolution) and then downscale it to 1x (86x40) as listed above.

Here are a few examples of approved badges that are of a quality well beyond the normal:

Badges that do not meet these standards will be refused with appropriate reasoning, and you may even be asked to completely redesign your badge if some features are particularly problematic. Please account for this.

### Requesting a Profile Badge For Your Tournament

If your tournament meets the criteria listed above, **please email tournaments@ppy.sh** and include the following information:

- The name of your tournament
- A brief description of your tournament, including its scoring type and any other appropriate features
- Any applicable dates for your tournament
- Any links to public off-site chatrooms or servers used for the event (Discord, etc)
- A link to the forum thread on the osu!forum that announces/details your tournament
- Any links to previous iterations of the same tournament (only where applicable)
- A list of the players involved in running the tournament
- A list of players who have registered for the tournament

You can send your initial request before the registrations of your tournament are closed. If you do this, you will have to send a follow-up email when the registrations are closed providing us with the list of players who have registered for the tournament to comply with the tournament screening requirements.

Please allow at **least** a week for a response. We will try our best to handle all requests within a week, but we occasionally have large spikes in workload that can make this impossible.

At the conclusion of your tournament you may submit a list of applicable recipients, along with all of the MP links of the winning team's matches. Your tournament will then be evaluated and based on professionality, quality and effort put into the tournament it may be granted a badge prize.

LAN tournaments are required to add VODs and MP links of the winning team/player, along with a bracket of the entire tournament in order to be considered for a badge prize.

**We reserve the right to withdraw this service should issues arise during the course of a tournament.**

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Why does a tournament have to run at least twice or more in order to qualify for profile badges without experienced staff present?

The second iteration of a tournament is often free of a lot of the organizational issues of the first tournament, and has established a solid workflow and staff involved in its production. They are far less likely to peter out or be subject to questionable choices. The tournament is also far more identifiable if it runs more than just once.

For all of these reasons (and more), we ask that profile badge prizes are only awarded to tournaments that have successfully run at least once before, unless a sizable majority of the team is experienced and accomplished at running tournaments in the past.

### What is considered 'staff' as far as tournament management goes?

We consider referees, mappool selectors, judges, team organizers, or any other form of managerial position directly involved in the maintenance and operation of a tournament to be a part of its staff.

Commentators are not considered by us as staff, and may play or interact in tournaments freely so long as they are not directly involved any managerial aspect of running the tournament or violate anything mentioned above.

We have historically had issues where unscrupulous organizers have geared tournaments specifically (ie: picked maps they're familiar with, adjusted seeds/brackets, etc) to farm profile badges for them and their friends. While we understand that most groups will not do this, we must enforce this restriction to keep things fair for everyone.

### Can a player who has been eliminated from play in my tournament join the staff after the fact and not cause problems?

Generally no, unless the role they are assuming is not one that could conceivably alter the outcome of the tournament.

A player may conclude play in your tournament and join as a commentator, for example, but not as a referee, organizer, or anything further.

### Why can't badges be awarded to recurring monthly (or weekly) tournaments?

Flooding the game with profile badges dilutes the prestige of the prize for everybody else. We do not want profile badges to be something that people 'farm' for from a few sets of regular, recurring tournaments.

### Can I request a badge for a beatmap contest or other type of competition?

For beatmap contests, yes, just follow the same rules as above.

For other contests, email us and ask personally. We'll try to work something out.

### Can a team-based tournament match be played if a team is missing a player?

Yes, a match can still be played even if one of the teams is missing one (or more) players.

### Can I request to advertise my tournament on the main menu?

Yes, you can. It's at the osu!team's discretion to decide if your tournament can be advertised in-game, as there are many factors to consider.

The minimum requirements to request in-game advertising are as follows:

- Your tournament meets the Criteria for Applicable Tournaments that can be found at the top of this article
- You have successfully run *at least* two tournaments in the past
- The live streams of your current tournament average over 100 concurrent viewers
- You are able to provide the schedule of the matches and live streams ahead of time
